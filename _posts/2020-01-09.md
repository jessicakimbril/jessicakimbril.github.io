title: My first project!

For my first project I decided to do a comparison of two main tank heroes. 

I used a dataset from kaggle and posted my blog on [Medium.](https://medium.com/@jessicakimbril/tank-comparison-dva-vs-rein-4714aa45c605)

I am also including a link to my [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-0NTDfEO1FA0aURxgqRyN5N0oLkry59N) in which I did all my exploring. This way you can follow my thought process.

This has been so much fun and I cannot wait until our next project!
